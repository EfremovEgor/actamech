              Submission to this journal proceeds totally online. Use the
              following guidelines to prepare your article via the ConfChairÂ®
              homepage of this journal (https://confchair.org) you will be
              guided stepwise through the creation and uploading of the various
              files. The system automatically converts source files to a single
              Adobe Acrobat PDF version of the article, which is used in the
              peer-review process. Please note that even though manuscript
              source files are converted to PDF at submission for the review
              process, these source files are needed for further processing
              after acceptance. All correspondence, including notification of
              the Editor's decision and requests for revision, takes place by
              e-mail and via the author's homepage, removing the need for a
              hard-copy paper trail.
            </p>

              You are recommended to use the Actamech Word article

            <p>
              The below guidance only refers to the writing process, and not to
              the use of AI tools to analyse and draw insights from data as part
              of the research process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where authors use generative artificial intelligence (AI) and
              AI-assisted technologies in the writing process, authors should
              only use these technologies to improve readability and language.
              Applying the technology should be done with human oversight and
              control, and authors should carefully review and edit the result,
              as AI can generate authoritative-sounding output that can be
              incorrect, incomplete or biased. AI and AI-assisted technologies
              should not be listed as an author or co-author, or be cited as an
              author. Authorship implies responsibilities and tasks that can
              only be attributed to and performed by humans, as outlined in
              Elsevier's AI policy for authors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors should disclose in their manuscript the use of AI and
              AI-assisted technologies in the writing process by following the
              instructions below. A statement will appear in the published work.
              Please note that authors are ultimately responsible and
              accountable for the contents of the work.
            </p>
            <p>Disclosure instructions</p>
            <p>
              Authors must disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted
              technologies in the writing process by adding a statement at the
              end of their manuscript in the core manuscript file, before the
              References list. The statement should be placed in a new section
              entitled 'Declaration of Generative AI and AI-assisted
              technologies in the writing process'
            </p>
            <p>
              Statement: During the preparation of this work the author(s) used
              [NAME TOOL / SERVICE] in order to [REASON]. After using this
              tool/service, the author(s) reviewed and edited the content as
              needed and take(s) full responsibility for the content of the
              publication

            <p>
              This declaration does not apply to the use of basic tools for
              checking grammar, spelling, references etc. If there is nothing to
              disclose, there is no need to add a statement.
