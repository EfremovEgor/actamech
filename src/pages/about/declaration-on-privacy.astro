				All the papers submitted to the Editorial office at the
				preliminary stage of consideration are to be inspected in
				relation to correctness of borrowings. Should there be any
				justified suspicions in plagiarism or should any technical
				tricks which can allow to hide it be detected a paper is not
				accepted for further consideration. Authors are informed about a
				paper rejection due to occurrence of suspicion in plagiarism.
				Should plagiarism be detected in a paper which has already been
				published such paper is retracted from publication without any
				possibility to be recovered (without physical removal and only
				by publishing a statement on plagiarism occurrence on the
				relevant web-pages on the journal web-site and a paper file).
				Should any incorrect borrowing occur in a submitted paper, all
				cases of such borrowings are to be considered individually.
			</p>
			<p>The Editorial office treat the following as plagiarism:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>
					use (word-for-word citing) of any materials in any volume
					without indicating a source;
				</li>
				<li>
					use of images, figures, photos, tables, graphs, schemes and
					any other graphic information without indicating a source;
				</li>
				<li>
					use of images, figures, photos, tables, graphs, schemes and
					any other graphic information published in scientific and
					popular editions without a copyright holder’s consent;
				</li>
				<li>
					absence of written consent to use materials authors or
					copyright holders of which forbid use of their materials
					without firm agreement.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The Editorial office treat the following as incorrect
				borrowings:
			</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>
					absence of graphic highlighting of a word-for-word cited
					text but with a link to s source;
				</li>
				<li>
					incorrect references (incomplete data on reference
					description of a source which make its identification rather
					complicated);
				</li>
				<li>
					a reference which is given not to the first source of a
					borrowed text without clear indication of the fact (an error
					in determining the original source);
				</li>
				<li>
					absence of references from the text to sources given in a
					paper references;
				</li>
				<li>
					excessive citing (when there are references to sources and
					graphic highlighting of a cited text), a volume of which
					cannot be justified by a paper genre and goals.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				An acceptable volume of citing (correct borrowings) cannot
				exceed 30% of the total paper volume. This requirement is not
				applicable to reviews and other papers which objectively require
				greater citing volumes. Such materials are considered by the
				Editorial office individually. Papers the content of which
				corresponds to other scientific materials of the same author
				(thesis, abstract of a thesis, monograph, previous publications
				in journals and collections) in volume greater than 30% are not
				accepted for publishing.

			<p>
				Revocation of text from the publication (retraction) is a
				mechanism of correcting the published information and alerts
				readers that the publication contains serious deficiencies or
				erroneous data that cannot be trusted. The unreliability of the
				data may be the result of bona fide error or deliberate
				violations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Retraction is also used to alert readers about the cases of
				duplicate publications (when authors present the same data in
				several publications), plagiarism and concealment of conflicts
				of interest that could affect the interpretation of the data or
				recommendations about their use.
