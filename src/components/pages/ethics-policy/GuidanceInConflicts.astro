      To avoid conflicts of interest between authors, reviewers, members of the
      editorial board or editorial staff related to commercial issues, work or
      personal relationships that could affect their actions or judgment each
      party should act in line with publication ethics policy adopted by the
      journal.

    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        The deputy editor or appointed secretary of the editorial board as
        instructed) should pass the manuscript to another reviewer if the
        previously appointed reviewer has conflicts of interest with the author
        (collective of authors) or the organization the author represents;
      </li>
      <li>
        inquire the information concerning potential conflicts of interest from
        authors, reviewers, members of the editorial board or editorial staff;
      </li>
      <li>
        make information concerning conflicts of interest related to the article
        under consideration public if this information is not confidential and
        may affect the evaluation of the published article by readers and
        scholarly community;
      </li>
      <li>
        timely publish corrections and clarifications if the information about
        the conflict of interest was obtained after the article had been
        published.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Authors (team of authors) are required to state their institutional
      affiliation and sources of their research funding related to the submitted
      manuscript. Reviewers are required to report the conflict of interest to
      the editor and decline to review the manuscript.
    </p>

    <p>
      The commitment to the above-mentioned publication ethics guidelines of all
      parties to the publication process (authors, reviewers, members of the
      editorial board editorial staff and editor-in-chief) would ensure the
      author`s intellectual property rights, better publication standards,
      promote research findings across audiences and eliminate the breach of
      authorship by the third party.
